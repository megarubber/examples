RobotPy Example Code
====================

**NOTE**: The `main` branch contains examples that work with the 2023 version
of RobotPy. While we don't change all that much every year, if you're looking
specifically for examples for older years, there are branches for different
years.

This repository contains lots of example code that can be used to learn more
about creating robots using RobotPy. These examples are for core
RobotPy/WPILib libraries. Examples specific to individual vendors can be
found in their individual RobotPy repository under their 'examples' folder:

* [Cross The Road Electronics (CTRE)](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-ctre/tree/main/examples)
* [NavX](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-navx/tree/main/examples)
* [REV Robotics](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-rev/tree/main/examples)

Contributions
-------------

WPILib (and the various vendors) have lots of examples that haven't been
translated from C++/Java into Python yet. If there's an example that you
found helpful for understanding how to write robot code, we'd love for you
to take a shot at translating it into python and contributing to this
repository!

Please check out our [porting guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a variety of
guidelines for new examples.
